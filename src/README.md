This repo includes some necessary parts in Autonomous Driving. All the Lab codes with "to do" comments are written by me.
The lab contains: 
1. ROS introduction;
2. Turtle bot simulation;
3. Autonomous Vehicle wall following with Switch sensor and Infrared sensor;
4. Image Processing with OpenCV3.3;
5. Lane detection;
6. Rviz and Gazebo simulation with task: Let Jackal UGV robot localize itself and pass throught two pillars.

Some Demo videos are uploaded on Youtube, please check the followings:
1. Wall Following with self-assembly robot based on Rasberry Pi: 
2. Lane Detection Result: 
3. Gazebo Simulation for Jackal UGV passing through two pillars:
