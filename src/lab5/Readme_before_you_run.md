Reminder:

Before you succeed to run the demo code in jackal drive, you need to follow the pdf manual to install Jackal Robot Simulator in this folder.
Besides, you need to download "rosserial-melodic-devel" into this folder, which can be easily found on ROS wiki by google it: https://github.com/ros-drivers/rosserial.git
PS: This Melodic serial version also works with Kinetic ROS, just go and get it!
